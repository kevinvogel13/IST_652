The conspiracy that Pete Carroll changed a run play to a pass play so Russell Wilson would win MVP over Marshawn Lynch is beyond idiotic

Still can't get over the Seahawks not giving marshawn lynch the ball on the one yardline
Marshawn Lynch has not been stopped for a loss more than once in a game since Week 12 vs Arizona (November 23).
"Still blows my mind that you don't hand the ball off to Marshawn Lynch at the 1yd line, 1st and goal, with 20 seconds left, and a timeout.."
Stats from the Seahawks season: 4/5 times they handed the ball off to marshawn lynch at the 1 yard line he got stopped.

Marshawn Lynch makes me want to start watching football....probably won't though. I just don't got the time to be honest.
Every time I think about how crappy today is I just think about how my day can't be worse than Marshawn Lynch's was yesterday
"#PeteCarroll is to #MarshawnLynch, as #MattWilliams is to #JordanZimmermann. https://vine.co/v/OFzAJehhMzh"
Hey remember when Pete Carroll decided to throw the ball on 2nd & goal instead of running it with Marshawn Lynch and sealing a championship
Budweiser wisely went all in on a puppy. And it worked. The puppy is Marshawn Lynch w/ the ball on 2nd-4th down. Pete Carroll is the farmer.
